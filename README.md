# Neovim Nice Tuned Configuration!

This is a Neovim Configuration purely in Lua and nicely tuned!

The best preconfigured neovim's distros I've seen till now are:

1. [https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim](LunarVim) 
2. [https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad](NvChad) 
3. [https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim](doom-nvim) 

So you can use them for your neovim customization!

### Good Luck with that!
